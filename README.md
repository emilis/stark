#### MPC compiler for the Web

**Status:** This is a work in progress. A lot of rough edges. Also don't expect much backwards compatibility between versions.

## Quick Start

Run this in your terminal:

```bash
npm install -g stark
stark new yoursite
cd yoursite
stark serve
```

Then open the printed link in your browser (usually it's <http://localhost:7780>). You should see a page like this:
